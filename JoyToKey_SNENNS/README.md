# SNENNS Controller (Super Nintendo Entertainment Newport News Shipyard Controller)

Config Files to turn an SNES controller into a Mouse, with one handed functionality. This was created for a Hackathon (RamHacks 2018) by me, Trevor LeForge (forg3y) for the Newport News Shipyard challenge, in which they were unable to use their touch screen computers due to their bulky gloves preventing them from using their fingers. One handed mode was for the use case in which the ship builder is using a hand to hold something (say wires) and they still need to use the controller to look at the instructions on what they're building at the moment. 

## Getting Started

All you'll need to do is head over to [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/download) and download the latest build of JoyToKey, then unzip. Download the config files above and ensure everything is in the same folder. That should be it! You should be able to plug in any USB SNES controller and can use it as a mouse. 

## Config File Usage
The way this works is by profile swapping.
A button while in "Two-Handed mode" (TH) will swap between different cursor speeds allowing for both precise movements and for quick dashes across the screen. 
Left trigger is left click. 
Right trigger is right click.
Y button switches to "One-Handed mode" (OH) 

Pressing Y while in OH will change speeds
Left trigger is left click
Select is right click
Right on the Dpad is up, Left is down, up is left, and down is right. It is intended to hold the controller in one hand with the dpad at the "bottom" and the buttons on the "top"(almost like a tv remote?). A claw grip is needed for optimal use (right clicking and moving is tricky without a claw like grip).
B button switches back to TH.

## Extras

If you want to learn more about how JoyToKey works, read the README that comes with the download of JoyToKey! If you make some changes I'd be intrested to know, so please feel free to contact me. Also consider purchasing a liscense to support the devs! It is 7 dollars and allows you to use the exe for longer, and on multiple PC's.
