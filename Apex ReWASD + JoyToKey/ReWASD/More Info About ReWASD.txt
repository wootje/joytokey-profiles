In Game Toggles

Looting Player Boxes: 
    - I use Mouse Button 4 (Foward Mouse Button) to toggle for looting... Using native keyboard and mouse.
    ALMOST always I would go to player box who has just been killed fully and
    I would hold R (on keyboard) to open up the box then I would press Mouse Button 4 (Foward Mouse Button) 
    to nativly use mouse to loot. EZ PZ don't ask how to change that bind cause that is a shit show...

Inventory Management or Anything in the Inventory:
    - This is pretty cool imo... just press tab (on keyboard)
    and you can use native mouse to manage inventory.
    Then press tab again and it SHOULD automatically put you back to controller input.
    - Sometimes inventory will bug while playing in game
    and you wont be able to use native mouse input just press Mouse Button 4 to toggle it.

Heals/Meds Selection:
    - I hold down 4 (on keyboard) and use mouse to select either shield battery, syringe, etc...

Grenades/Blow Stuff Up Selection:
    - I hold down Middle Mouse Button to select either grenade, arcstar, etc...
